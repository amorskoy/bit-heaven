Place to play with algorithms, data structures, modeling and distributed calcs with Scala and Python

## Members 
Andrey Morskoy - Scala developer

Oleg Pashun - Python developer

## The idea

We trust, that perfect solution for interesting mathematical games forms balance by criterias:
1. Design
* complexity of data structure
* complexity of algorithm

2. Implementation
* transaperncy of source code
* programm performance

Our purpose is to play with this balance keeping resulting code as transparent as possible when solving diferent kind of math games
